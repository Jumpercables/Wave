Some features are important enough to have their own page in the docs, others will simply be listed.\n\n\nSeamless\n\n\nWave is built using \n.NET Extension Methods\n which allows for adding new features to existing interfaces and classes within the ArcGIS and ArcFM APIs. Any interfaces or objects that are extended have been setup to use the namespace of the object, which allows Wave\ns features to be available without adding new namespace delcarations.\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, the \nRowExtensions.cs\n that contains extension methods for the \nIRow\n interface uses the \nESRI.ArcGIS.Geodatabase\n namespace because that is the namespace that contains the \nIRow\n interface.\n\n\n\n\nLINQ\n\n\nThe \nwhile\n statement is used in conjunction with the ArcFM and ArcGIS APIs to iterate through collections using the \nReset()\n and \nNext()\n method combinations. However, in most cases the \nforeach\n statement is the preferred method, thus the most frequently used iterators can be converted to an enumerable type using the \nAsEnumerable()\n extension method, which allows these collections to now take advantage of \nLINQ\n.\n\n\nThe following is a short list of the interfaces that support enumerable types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESRI\n\n\nArcFM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nILongArray\n\n\nIMMEnumField\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIArray\n\n\nIMMEnumTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEnumDomain\n\n\nIMMEnumObjectClass\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEnumBSTR\n\n\nIMMEnumFeederSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEnumIDs\n\n\nIMMPxNodeHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIFields\n\n\nIMMEnumPxTransition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEnumRelationshipClass\n\n\nIMMPxNode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEnumFeatureClass\n\n\nIMMEnumPxState\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICursor\n\n\nIMMEnumPxTasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIFeatureCursor\n\n\nIMMEnumPxUser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISet\n\n\nIMMEnumPxFilter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\nThere are many more that haven\nt been listed for the sake of brevity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese new extension methods allow you to write code like this:\n\n\nint count = cursor.AsEnumerable().Count();\n\n\n\n\nand:\n\n\nvar results =\n    from x in cursor1.AsEnumerable()\n    from y in cursor2.AsEnumerable()\n    where x.get_Value(0) = y.get_Value(0)\n    select new { Left = x, Right = y };\n\n\n\n\nThere are several objects (i.e. \nIEnumLayer\n, \nIMap\n, \nID8List\n) in ArcFM and ArcGIS APIs that require recursion to obtain all of the data. In the past, you\nd have to create a recursive method for iterating the contents of these hierarchical structures. These structures can now be traversed recursively using \nLINQ\n.\n\n\n\n\nTraversing the contents of the \nIMap\n.\n\n\n\n\npublic void ClearDefinitions(IMap map)\n{\n    var layerDefinitions = map.Where(o =\n o.Visible).Select(o =\n (IFeatureLayerDefinition2) o)\n    foreach (var layerDefinition in layerDefinitions)\n    {\n        layerDefinition.DefinitionExpression = null;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraversing the contents of the \nID8List\n.\n\n\n\n\npublic void UpdateTags(ID8List list, string tag)\n{\n    var items = list.Where(o =\n o is IMMProposedObject).Select(o =\n (IMMProposedObject) o.Value)\n    foreach (var item in items)\n    {\n        IMMFieldManager fieldManager = item.FieldManager;\n        IMMFieldAdapter fieldAdapter = fieldManager.FieldByName(\nTAG\n);\n        fieldAdapter.Value = tag;\n        item.Update(null);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nData Access\n\n\nOne of the major benefits of using the ESRI platform it allows you to perform spatial and attribute based queries against the data to validate and perform analysis.
