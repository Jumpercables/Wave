# Unit Tests #
The unit tests that have been created for the Wave project are **not** using **Mock** objects. The reasoning behind this decision, is strictly due to lack of time available to properly create infrastructure for mocking ArcObjects. Until that day comes, the unit testing relies heavily on the sample data.

## Sample Data ##
The sample data used for the unit testing is much to large to be committed to GitHub. If you want to run the unit tests you'll need to download it from the ArcFM Resource Center.
