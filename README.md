Wave is a C# library that extends the ESRI ArcObjects and Schneider Electric ArcFM APIs that are used for developing Geographical Information System (GIS) extensions to the ArcMap and ArcFM software or stand-alone applications. The library uses extension methods to extend the functionality of existing objects and provide workable wrappers around commonly used COM objects.
