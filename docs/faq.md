## 1. What is Wave?
Wave is meant to provide a simplistic approach to extending the ArcGIS and ArcFM platforms by providing simplified implementations for complex operations, frequently use call stacks, enforcing the recommended best practices and create a seamless integration with the ArcFM Solution.

## 2. What was the motivation?
Over the years as a developer in the Geographic Information System (GIS) for Utilities industry there's been an increasing need for a way to make development easier as the industries needs increase in complexity.

## 3. What is ArcGIS?
[ArcGIS](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/getting-started/articles/026n00000014000000.htm) is a comprehensive system that allows people to collect, organize, manage, analyze, communicate, and distribute geographic information. As the world's leading platform for building and using geographic information systems (GIS), ArcGIS is used by people all over the world to put geographic knowledge to work in government, business, science, education, and media. ArcGIS enables geographic information to be published so it can be accessed and used by anyone. The system is available everywhere using web browsers, mobile devices such as smartphones, and desktop computers.

## 4. What is ArcFM?
[ArcFM](http://www.schneider-electric.com/solutions/ww/en/sol/26048721-geospatial-intelligence--arcfm-solution?other=-1) is an Enterprise GIS with reliable network intelligence that provides information such as pipe water direction flows, the number of customers attached to a gas meter, and what devices are downstream of a particular fuse.

## 5. Do I need both ArcFM and ArcGIS to use Wave?
Wave has been developed with it's dependencies in mind to allow the library to be used in two different ways:

1. When only the **ArcGIS for Desktop** is installed, you'll want to install the **Wave Extensions for ArcGIS** package.

2. When both the **ArcGIS for Desktop** and **ArcFM Solution**, you'll want to install the **Wave.Extensions.Miner**  package.

## 6. Do I need a license to use Wave?
Wave is open-source and doesn't directly require any licenses, however since both **ArcFM** and **ArcGIS** are commercial software packages that require licenses. You will need a license for **ArcGIS** and **ArcFM** to use Wave.
