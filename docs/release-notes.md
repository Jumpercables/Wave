## Backlog
These are the changes, additions, removals that are actively being worked on and will be included in future releases.

### New

- Added `Version` and `BuildNumber` to the `ArcFM` static class. [^2]
- Added `GetVisibleLayers` extension method to the `IMap` interface which will return only those layers that are visible (either by virtue of being enabled or due to scale suppression). [^1]
- Added *Linear Referencing* support classes in the `ESRI.ArcGIS.Location` namespace. [^1]
- Added `Export` extension methods to the `IFeatureClass` and `ITable` interface which allows for exporting the data to another data source. [^1]
- Added `Delete` extension methods to the `IFeatureClass` and `ITable` interface for deleting the object from the database. [^1]
- Added support for converting `Dictionary{string, TValue}` into a `DynamicObject` using the `ToDynamic` extension method off the `Dictionary{string, TValue}` class. [^1] [^5]
- Added support for converting `XDocument` into a `DynamicObject` using the `ToDynamic` extension method off the `XDocument` class. [^1] [^5]
- Added support for converting the `IRowBuffer` into a `DynamicObject` using the `ToDynamic` extension method off the `IRowBuffer` interface. [^1] [^5]

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `GetAutoValue` extension methods were recursively searching too deep for the auto values.
- Fixed issue with `ReadCsv` extension method for the `DataTable` that wasn't opening the ADO connection prior to executing the read, which was causing an exception.

## Version 1.0.3 - 2016-04-04
### New
- Added `PerformOperation` extension methods to the `IEditor`, `IMMEditor`, `IWorkspace` and `IWorkspaceEdit` interfaces that wrap the start / stop operation constructs. [^3]
- Added `ExecuteTask` extension method on the `IMMPxNode` object to execute tasks based on name. [^2]
- Added `CompatibleUnit` and `WorkLocation` node objects. [^2]
- Added `GetActiveTab` extension method to the `IMMAttributeEditor` interface to allow for returning the `ID8List` for the tab that is selected in the ArcFM Attribute Editor. [^2]
- Added `Pan`, `Zoom`, and `Flash` extension methods to the `IFeature` interface to allow for performing these actions when the proper hook is supplied. [^1]
- Added `Unhighlight` extension method for unhighlighting features. [^2]

### Changed
- The `GetDataChanges` extension methods on the `IVersion` interface returns a `DeltaRowCollection` instead of a `List{DeltaRow}` as the accessor methods on the `DeltaRow` have been moved to the `DeltaRowCollection` class to allow for better performance. [^1] [^4]
- The `ESRI.ArcGIS.Framework.BaseClasses` namespace was replaced with the `ESRI.ArcGIS.ADF.BaseClasses` namespace. [^1] [^4]
- The `Miner.Framework.BaseClasses` namespace was replaced with the `Miner.Interop` namespace. [^2] [^4]
- Moved the `IProgressBarAnimation` interface into the `ESRI.ArcGIS.Framework` namespace [^1]

## Version 1.0.2 - 2016-03-03
### Fixed
- Due to an issue with the build server the 4.5 .NET Framework packages were not included.

---

### New
- The packages now support the 3.5 and 4.5 .NET Framework. [^3]
- The 4.5 .NET Framework packages now include supporting `async` methods. [^3]

### Added
- Added `Execute` extension method to the `ISqlWorkspace` interface to support query cursors. [^1]
- Added `GetWorkspaces` extension method to the `IApplication` interface which will return the `IMMStandardWorkspace` interface that will give the `LoginWorkspace`, `LibraryWorkspace`, and `EditWorkspace`. [^2]
- Added getter property for the `Locked` property on the `IPxControlUI` interface. [^2]
- Added `GetCULibrary` to the `IApplication` interface which will return the `ICuLibrary` interface used for interacting with the storage of the library. [^2]
- Added `GetHistory` extension methods to the `IMMPxApplication` for retrieving historical data for nodes. [^2]
- Added `GetNodeTypeName` extension method to the `IMMPxApplication` to reduce the number of casts necessary to retrieve the information from the node objects. [^2]


### Removed
- The `CreateNew` and `Initialize` methods on the `IPxNode` interface have been removed. [^2] [^4]
- The `ReferenceDictionary` has been replaced with the `ToDictionary` extension method on the `Miner.Interop.Process.IDictionary` which converts it to `Dictionary{String, Object}`. [^2] [^4]

### Changed
- Using overloading mechanism instead of the optional parameters. [^3]
- The `Session`, `Design` and `WorkRequest` classes updated to reflect changes to the `IPxNode` interface and now create and initialize based on the constructor parameters. [^2]
- Instance members should not write to `static` fields in `ComboTreeDropDown`. [^1]
- Removed `virtual` from the `DictionaryChanged` and `DictionaryChanging` events in the `ObservableDictionary` [^1]
- Initialize the `BehaviorsProperty` property in static constructor in the `CommandBehaviorCollection` [^1]
- Defined the locale to be used in `String` operations. [^3]
- The `StartEditing` extension methods on the `IVersion` and `IWorkspace` interfaces were removed, as they were duplicates of the `PerformOperation` methods.[^1] [^4]
- The `BaseAutoText` implementation no longer requires the `progId` parameter in the constructor as it is derived from the `ProgIdAttribute` that is assigned to the class. [^2] [^4]
- A `Design` can no longer be created as an orphan, it requires a `WorkRequest` or `IMMWMSWorkRequest` to be constructed.
