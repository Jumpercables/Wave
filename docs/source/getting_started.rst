Getting Started
================================
There are two ways for getting started using Wave.

GitHub
---------------------
You can visit `GitHub <https://github.com/Jumpercables/Wave>`_ to download and compiled the source. Once compiled you can reference the assemblies in your projects.



Microsoft Package Manager
--------------------------------------
In the future, Wave will be publicly distributed using the `Nuget <http://www.nuget.org>`_ service that is available to the .NET community within Visual Studios. 

- This will allow users the option to simply install the assemblies without having to compile the source code.

.. warning::

    This is on the roadmap but not implemented yet.

Requirements
--------------------
The prerequisites for developing and running Wave require a combination of open source and commercial software.
