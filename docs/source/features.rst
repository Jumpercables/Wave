Features
================================
This will serve as a list of all of the features that are currently available. Some features are important enough to have their own page in the docs, others will simply be listed.

Namespaceless
--------------------------
Wave is built using `.NET Extension Methods <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx>`_ which allows for adding new features to existing interfaces and classes within the ArcGIS and ArcFM APIs. Any interfaces or objects that are extended have been setup to use the namespace of the object, which allows Wave's features to be available without adding new namespace delcarations.

- For instance, the ``RowExtensions.cs`` that contains extension methods for the ``IRow`` interface uses the ``ESRI.ArcGIS.Geodatabase`` namespace because that is the namespace that contains the ``IRow`` interface.

Enumerable Types 
-----------------------
The ``while`` statement is used throught the ArcFM and ArcGIS API to iterate through collections using the ``Reset()`` and ``Next()`` method combinations. However, in most cases the ``foreach`` statement is the preferred method, thus the most frequently used iterators can be converted to an enumerable type using the ``AsEnumerable()`` extension method.

The following is a short list of the interfaces that support enumerable types:

Simplifying Complexity
--------------------------
Wave is designed to simplify complex and frequently used tasks all while considering performance, memory consumption and easy of use.

Hierarchical Data Structures
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are several objects (i.e. ``IEnumLayer``, ``IMap``, ``ID8List``) in ArcFM and ArcGIS APIs that require recursion to obtain all of the data. In the past, you'd have to create a recursive method for iterating the contents of these hierarchical structures. These structures can now be traversed recursively using ``LINQ``.

For example, in ArcGIS traversing the contents of the map document has been simplified with the introduction of the ``Where`` extension method on the ``IMap`` interface.

.. code-block:: c#

    /// <summary>
    /// Clears the layer definitions.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="map">The map document within ArcMap.</param>
    public void ClearDefinitions(IMap map)
    {
        foreach (var layerDefinition in map.Where(o => o.Visible).Select(o => (IFeatureLayerDefinition2) o))
        {
            layerDefinition.DefinitionExpression = null;
        }
    }
    
For example, in ArcFM traversing the Design Tab in the ArcFM Attribute Editor has been simplified with the introduction of the ``Where`` extension method on the ``ID8List`` interface.

.. code-block:: c#

    /// <summary>
    /// Update all of the TAG field with the specified value for all features
    /// that reside within the Design Tab.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="list">The tree structure for the Design tab on the ArcFM attribute editor.</param>
    /// <param name="tag">The tag information.</param>
    public void UpdateTags(ID8List list, string tag)
    {
        foreach (var item in list.Where(o => o is IMMProposedObject).Select(o => (IMMProposedObject) o.Value))
        {
            IMMFieldManager fieldManager = item.FieldManager;
            IMMFieldAdapter fieldAdapter = fieldManager.FieldByName("TAG");
            fieldAdapter.Value = tag;
            item.Update(null);
        }		
    }

Data Queries
+++++++++++++
One of the major benefits of using the ESRI platform it allows you to perform spatial and attribute based queries against the data to validate and perform analysis. As side-effect, the same APIs are used repeatively, which leads to code-duplication and/or memory management issues if used improperly.

The ``ITable`` and ``IFeatureClass`` interfaces have been extended to include ``Fetch`` methods that simplifies queries by abstracting the complexities while enforcing the proper memory management for the COM objects.

.. code-block:: c#	

    /// <summary>
    ///     Updates all of the features 'TIMECREATED' field to the current date time for
    ///     those features that have NULLs.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="featureClass">The feature class.</param>
    /// <returns>
    ///     Returns a <see cref="int" /> representing the number of records updated.
    /// </returns>
    public int UpdateTimeCreated(IFeatureClass featureClass)
    {
        IQueryFilter filter = new QueryFilterClass();
        filter.WhereClause = "TIMECREATED IS NULL";
        
        int recordsAffected = featureClass.Fetch(filter, feature =>          
        {		   
            feature.Update("TIMECREATED", DateTime.Now);
            feature.Store();

            // Return true, to continue to the next feature.
            return true;
        });

        return recordsAffected;
    }

ArcFM Model Names
------------------------------
The ArcFM Solution provides a way to identify ESRI tables and fields based on a user defined key that are call ArcFM Model Names. These model names can be for cross-database or generic implementations for customziations. However, they must be accessed using a singleton object, which tends to lead to the creation of class helper.

In order to simplfy the accessing of model name information, several extension methods were added to the ESRI objects that support ArcFM Model Names.

The extension methods for the ``IFeatureClass`` and ``ITable`` interfaces that have been added.

- ``IsAssignedClassModelName``: Used to determine if a class model name(s) has been assigned.
- ``IsAssignedFieldModelName``: Used to determine if a field model name(s) has been assigned.
- ``GetRelationshipClass``: Used to locate the relationship that has been assigned the class model name(s).
- ``GetRelationshipClasses``: Used to gather a list of the relationships that has been assigned the class model name(s).
- ``GetField``: Used to locate the ``IField`` that has been assigned the field model name(s).
- ``GetFields``: Used to gather a list of of the ``IField`` objects that has been assigned the field model name(s).
- ``GetFieldIndex``: Used to locate the field index that has been assigned the field model name(s).
- ``GetFieldIndexes``: Used to gather a list of all of the field indexes that has been assigned the field model name(s).
- ``GetFieldName``: Used to locate the field name that has been assigned the field model name(s).
- ``GetFieldNames``: Used to gather a list of all of the field names that has been assigned the field model name(s).
    
The extension methods for the ``IWorkspace`` interface that have been added.

- ``IsAssignedDatabaseModelName``: Use to determine if the database model name(s) has been assigned.
- ``GetFeatureClass``: Used to obtain the ``IFeatureClass`` that has been assigned the class model name(s).
- ``GetFeatureClasses``: Used to obtain all of the ``IFeatureClass`` tables that have been assigned the class model name(s).
- ``GetTable``: Used to obtain the ``ITable`` that has been assigned the class model name(s).
- ``GetTables``: Used to obtain all of the ``ITable`` tables that have been assigned the class model name(s).

    public IEnumerable<string> CreateHtml(IWorkspace workspace, int uniqueId, string directory, Stream styleSheet)
    {        
        var featureClasses = workspace.GetFeatureClasses("EXTRACT");
        foreach(var featureClass in featureClasses)
        {
            string whereClause;
            
            // Make the filter, which is based on the uniqueId.
            if(featureClass.IsAssignedFieldModelName("FEEDERID"))
            {
                whereClause = string.Format("{0} = {1}", featureClass.GetFieldName("FEEDERID"), uniqueId);
