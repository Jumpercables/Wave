=======================

Wave is open-source and, as such, grows (or shrinks) & improves in part due to the community. 

There are many ways to get involved. You can:

* download the latest build
* check out and build the source code

Once you have either of these, you can help by:

* reporting bugs you find
* providing reductions to bugs
* submitting patches for review
