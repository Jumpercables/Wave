Welcome to Wave!
================================
Wave is a C# library that extends the ESRI ArcObjects and Schneider Electric ArcFM 
APIs by developing extension classes for existing objects and providing workable wrappers
around commonly used COM objects.

The concept is to eliminate the need for the developer to learn new namespaces and api, but allow them to take advantage
of the Visual Studio IDE to identify the new methods for objects. That being said, it's always best to consult the
:doc:`api` documentation to understand the purpose of the methods and classes.
