# General
The ArcFM and ArcGIS platform provides multiple extension points and while we cannot address them all we have included abstract implementations for the most common extensions made while working with these software packages.

Class                  | Description
:----------------------|:-------------
 `BaseMxCommand`     | Creating a button within the ArcMap application.                                   
 `BaseGxCommand`     | Creating a button within the ArcCatalog application.                               
 `BaseExtension`     | Creating an extension within the ArcMap application.                                
 `BaseTool`          | Creating a tool within the ArcMap application.                                     
 `BaseAbandonAU`     | Creating a custom trigger for abandoning features.                            
 `BaseAttributeAU`   | Creating a custom trigger for a field when the object is created, updated or deleted.
 `BaseSpecialAU`     | Creating a custom trigger for the object when it is created, updated or deleted.    
 `BaseRelationshipAU`| Creating a custom trigger for when a relationship is created, updated or deleted.   
 `BasePxSubtask`     | Creating a sub-routine that can be assigned to tasks within the Process Framework.  
 `...`                 | *There are many more that haven't been listed for the sake of brevity.*

## Model Names
The ArcFM Solution provides a way to identify ESRI tables and fields based on a user defined key that are call Class, Field and Database Model Names. These model names can be for cross-database or generic implementations. However, they must be accessed using a singleton object, which tends to lead to the creation of class helper.

In order to simplify the accessing of model name information, several extension methods were added to the ESRI objects that support ArcFM Model Names.

The extension methods for the `IFeatureClass` and `ITable` interfaces that have been added.

 `...`                         | *There are many more that haven't been listed for the sake of brevity.*

A list of extension methods for the `IWorkspace` interface that have been added.
